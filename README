Bugs: This isn't super efficient for very large result sets (> 10,000
rows).  I'm not planning on optimizing for larger result sets since
this for use on the console and most people keep their console output
to <= 10,000 rows.  Besides, who wants to pick through > 1,000 rows on
the command line (OK, I sometimes do...)?  Anyways, I've hardcoded the
DB class to only return 10,000 rows.  This prevents users from
watching millions of rows scroll by.  If you want something different,
change it and test it.
